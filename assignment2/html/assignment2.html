		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, you will be implementing Structure from Motion. 
			<ul>
				<li>Feature Matching</li>
				<li>Structure from Motion</li>
			</ul>
			We have made available a visualization tool using the Three.js library implemented in "./js/assignment2.js" and an example implementation located in "./assignments/assignment2.py". Your objective is to fill in TODOs in the python files and make modification based on it. You are encouraged to use a programming language with which you are comfortable. The output results should be in the ply format, and you must visualize your outcomes accordingly. 
			<br><br>
			<b>How to Submit: </b>Please submit this template file along with your implementation as a zip file. The zip file should contain your source code, the generated results in PLY mesh format, and a report that has been modified using this HTML file. The report should comprise your results and a concise explanation of your implementation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a GitHub repository containing all these elements and provide a link for submission.
			<br><br>
			<b>Requirements / Rubric: </b>The grading is based on the correctness of your implementation. You are encouraged to use the visualization tool to debug your implementation. You can also use the visualization tool to test your implementation on other 3D models. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>+80 pts: Implement the structure-from-motion algorithm with the start code.  </li>
					<li>+20 pts: Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results (reprojection error) and visualisations, compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap.</li>
					<li>+10 pts: Extra credit (see below)</li>
					<li>-5*n pts: Lose 5 points for every time (after the first) you do not follow the instructions for the hand in format</li>
				</ul>
			<b>Extract Credit:</b> You are free to complete any extra credit:
				<ul>
					<li>up to 5 pts: Present results with your own captured data.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Implement Bundle Adjustment in incremental SFM.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Implement multi-view stereo (dense reconstruction).</li>
					<li>up to 20 pts: Create mobile apps to turn your SFM to a scanner.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Any extra efforts you build on top of basic SFM.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Algorithm</h2>
		In this assignment, I implemented incremental Structure from Motion (SFM). The process begins with feature matching across every pair of images. During the initialization phase, it's essential to select two non-panoramic views and triangulate inlier correspondences to generate 3D point clouds. For each subsequent view, the first step involves identifying 2D-3D correspondences and solving the Perspective-n-Point problem to obtain the view's projection matrix. Following outlier removal via RANSAC, new 3D points are integrated into the results through triangulation.		
		<br><br>
		In my implementation, I adapted the methodology from <i>triangulate_two_views</i> to develop <i>trangulate_new_view</i>. . A critical step in this process is the removal of outliers prior to triangulation, as it can substantially reduce the reprojection error. To eliminate outliers, I employed RANSAC with a threshold of 0.9. For calculating the reprojection error, I followed the formula provided in the lecture slides, which involves computing the distance between the reprojected points and the actual points.
		<h2>Results</h2>
		The reprojection errors for "fountain-P11" are as follows: 0.48, 0.49, 0.29, 1.62, 1.00, 1.60, 1.79, 5.72, 12.85, 9.45, with an average error of 3.93. The reprojection errors and the 3D point clouds can be reviewed in the <i>assets</i> folder. . This data indicates that most reprojected points overlap with the actual points, affirming the accuracy of the implemented algorithm. For this submission, due to size constraints, all image files in the <i>Benchmarking_Camera_Calibration_2008</i> folder have been removed. Please re-add the files to this folder to run the code successfully.
